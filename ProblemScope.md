## Context
### Problem Overview
Every major holiday hundreds of Rice students travel back home to meet their friends or family or start work, and return back to Rice when the school picks up again, making on avergae 4 to 6 trips to and from the airport. Most students end up taking peer-to-peer
services like Uber and Lyft to ride to the airport, and the cost can easily add up. For
this reason, many student try to find other students from Rice also travelling to the 
airport aroundly the same time to carpool and share the cost with. To connect people from 
across the campus, Harrison Lin, a now graduted Rice student, creates a Google Docs sheets 
and a Facebook page. 
*What is the google docs sheets?*                                   
The current Google Docs Sheets is an excel document recording past and future carpool 
rides that contain the destination, date/time, student’s name, phone number, and other 
information. The idea is that students can enter the time they plan to leave Rice or the
airport, and if someone else matches with their time, they can contact each other and 
coordinate a ride. 

*What is wrong with google sheets?*
Although the idea aims to make the process of carpooling convinent, there are many reasons why it 
is not the most effective way of implementing the idea: 
1. It doesnt not have a smooth interface, therefore people prefer to not use it. Since all rides are on one sheet, it is hard to navigate rides, due to congestion and scrolling.
2. There are not enough successful rides, most rides on the page end up with a single person because of disregard of factors like time flexibility, so even rides that differ by 30 mins are separate rides, even if the creator of the ride has flexible timing. since they don't provide a time frame.
3. There is also the security concerns with exposing one’s personal information on a public page. 
  - Anyone can alter information on the excel sheet, such as deleting/changing information. 
4. There is no notification if a rider joins or leaves your ride, which means people either don't turn up for rides they signed up for.
